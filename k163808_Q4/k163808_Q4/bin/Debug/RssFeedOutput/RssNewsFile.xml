  <Title>Time for the world to give more respect to Pakistan, says UK army ex-general</Title>
  <Description>
    

LONDON: A retired senior British Army officer has said that Pakistan has established order within its borders under the military command of General Qamar Javed Bajwa. In an article for the Spectator magazine, Major-General (retired) Jonathan David Shaw wrote that the visit by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to Pakistan is &amp;ldquo;showcasing Pakistan as it is today&amp;rdquo; rather than the past, and that the visit shows how Pakistan has transformed its internal security situation. Jonathan Shaw recently visited Pakistan and toured various areas. The author is the former head of the SAS, as well as being the two-star in charge of Pakistan policy. In addition to his former special forces background the Oxford educated General regularly writes for the Financial Times, Telegraph and Spectator.&amp;ldquo;When I used to go to Pakistan regularly over the period 2009-10, I saw a country facing an existential crisis. Pakistan harbours 2.7million refugees from the 1979 then 2001 invasions in Afghanistan,&amp;rdquo; wrote the army officer, noting that the real psychological turning point for the country came after the attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar in 2014 by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which killed around 158 people.Shaw wrote that action against militants has yielded dividends for Pakistan. &amp;ldquo;I visited the Khyber Pass section of the 833km fence, with 700 guard forts along its route, soon to be augmented by CCTV and sensor devices. This $1bn effort has choked off the Haqqani and TTP terrorist networks. And in a further sign of national CT resolve, all those on the US &amp;lsquo;watch-list&amp;rsquo; in Pakistan have been arrested. Much credit for this must go to the Chief of the Army Staff, General Bajwa. He was picked as COAS over the heads of more senior officers on account of his strong pro-democracy attitudes.&amp;rdquo; He wrote that gen Bajwa has proved himself &amp;ldquo;an able interlocutor in trying to de-escalate tensions in Yemen, between KSA and Iran, and of course in Afghanistan.&amp;rdquo; Jonathan Shaw wrote that General Bajwa has focused on supporting the softer aspects of societal regrowth. General Bajwa told Jonathan Shaw for the Spectator article: &amp;ldquo;A strong army needs a sovereign economy.&amp;rdquo;He added: &amp;ldquo;His character and broad vision for the overall strength of Pakistan explains why PM Imran Khan has recently extended him for a second three year term. And he is well-matched to his PM, who has shown strength and courage with his anti-corruption drive, his Peace and Prosperity agenda and his release of the Indian pilot shot down in the Pulwama incident in Kashmir this February.&amp;rdquo;He added: &amp;ldquo;As what has become known as the &amp;lsquo;Bajwa doctrine&amp;rsquo; has it, now is not the time to ask for more from Pakistan; now is the time for the world to give more respect to Pakistan.&amp;rdquo;</Description>

  <Title>Penny Appeal CEO Aamer Naeem embroilled in controversy </Title>
  <Description>
    

LONDON: Leading British Muslim charity Penny Appeal&amp;rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Aamer Naeem OBE is at the centre of an explosive bullying, harassment and intimidation storm following grievances and complains, full of allegations, launched by a number of senior executives.Sources at the Wakefield based charity have told this reporter that a number of senior members of the charity have launched complaints that Aamer Naeem allegedly presided over campaigns of targeted harassment, including attempts to literally drive people out of the organisation in a bid to cover his own leadership failings.One of the complaints includes details of how one female member of staff was reduced to tears and humiliation on numerous occasions, said a trusted source at the charity.Penny Appeal has been in news recently after its founder Adeem Younis was suspended in what some sources have described as an orchestrated coup to take power and control of one of the fastest growing Muslim charities in Britain.The founder of the charity and serial entrepreneur Adeem Younis was told at the airport, as he landed back at the Heathrow airport from a charity campaign with Pakistani A-lister Mehwish Hayat and Dragons&amp;rsquo; Dens star James Caan, that he was subject to a suspension. Adeem Younis was in Pakistan for ten days on behalf of the Penny Appeal for the charitable projects of the charity near Rawalpindi.Locks of the charity&amp;rsquo;s headquarters were changed, IT servers were removed which brought the work of the charity to a standstill for a number of weeks and full time security guards were hired to guard the building to prevent anyone unauthorised from entering the building, trusted sources shared what went on at the heart of the charity as the controversy grew.This reporter has seen leaked correspondence in which a female employee has accused that the CEO and his associates of an &amp;ldquo;orchestrated takeover of the organisation in order to protect his own failures &amp;rdquo;.This reporter has spoken to staff who said they were afraid of speaking up as they fear that they will lose their jobs. They have told that the place has become a &amp;ldquo;hostile environment&amp;rdquo; where no one dares mention the suspended chair&amp;rsquo;s name because they are under instructions not to speak to him in any circumstances. Several staff members have alleged that they are being punished and suffering because of the power struggle going on between Aamer Naeem and Adeem Younis. Both the founder and the CEO deny being involved in power struggle but the senior staff members have shared details of how heated exchanged took place in the run to the suspension of the founder by the CEO.  Further allegations and grievances include staff being denied door security codes as well as access to certain hard drives. Both the CEO and the founder are of Pakistani origin.A source shared that the suspension of Adeem Younis had been planned for several months. In one of the grievance papers, it has been alleged that Mr Younis was suspended with &amp;ldquo;ulterior motives&amp;rdquo;.Aamer Naeem was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) medal in the Queen&amp;rsquo;s 2019 New Year Honours list. Penny Appeal had said at the time that the award has been given for services to &amp;ldquo;Muslim Community Development&amp;rdquo;.Adeem Younis is know as a serial entrepreneur who founded Single Muslim site at a young age and turned it into a big success. It&amp;rsquo;s claimed that the site has helped to facilitate over 110,000 marriages. In 2018 he won Charity Chair of the Year award at the Third Sector Awards. Earlier this year, he was recognised by then Prime Minister Theresa May for his &amp;ldquo;exceptional service to the charity sector&amp;rdquo;.This correspondent sent questions to both Adeem Younis and Aamer Naeem but they didn&amp;rsquo;t reply. However, a source close to the Penny Appeal CEO denied all allegations and had nothing to do with the allegations. The source said that Aamer Naeem was doing everything possible to put the things right for the Penny Appeal. The Charity Commission has confirmed that it is looking into &amp;ldquo;potential concerns&amp;rdquo; after the charity had submitted a &amp;ldquo;serious incident report&amp;rdquo;.</Description>

  <Title>Prince William and Kate leave Pakistan after five-day pleasant tour</Title>
  <Description>
    

ISLAMABAD: Prince William and his wife Kate left Pakistan Friday after a tour dramatically capped by a terrifying mid-air plane drama which saw their Royal Air Force pilot abort two landings in a fierce thunderstorm over Islamabad.The turbulence from the Thursday evening storm during the flight from Lahore to Islamabad shook the plane so hard that seasoned foreign correspondents said they had never experienced anything like it. "It was pretty bumpy up there," the Daily Mail&amp;acute;s royal correspondent, Rebecca English, quoted the Duchess of Cambridge as saying. "If I&amp;acute;m honest ... that was the most nervous I&amp;acute;ve ever felt in a plane," said ITV royal correspondent Chris Ship, who was on board.The pilot of the RAF Voyager reportedly tried to land twice, once at a military base in the garrison city of Rawalpindi adjacent to the capital, and once at Islamabad International. But the storm, one of the many squalls that often hit Islamabad in October, proved too powerful."The pilot circled for an hour but the lightning - and turbulence - was so bad we had to fly back," tweeted English late Thursday.With the plane grounded in Lahore, some 270 kilometres (170 miles) from Islamabad, the UK High Commission had to rush to secure hotel rooms for the Prince, his wife -- and the roughly 100 people accompanying them, according to the travelling press. With security one of the top concerns throughout the trip, it was no small feat. But after a night at a five-star hotel in Lahore, the entourage was able to return to Islamabad Friday morning, just in time to visit an army centre in Islamabad where dogs are trained to sniff out explosives. Thursday&amp;acute;s mid-air drama did not appear to dampen the royal couple&amp;acute;s spirits, with the press pack reporting that William -- himself a pilot -- had joked with them shortly after that he had been the one flying the plane. There has been no statement yet from Kensington Palace on the flight drama.- Huge smiles -A planned trip to the famed Khyber Pass -- one of the two major border crossings into Afghanistan -- was called off after the flight drama.The couple -- the Duchess wearing one final shalwar kameez in black and white, after highlighting the traditional Pakistani long tunic and trousers throughout the trip -- then boarded the Voyager once more, waving for the cameras one last time before departing.It was the Cambridge&amp;acute;s first official trip to Pakistan, and a significant vote of confidence from the UK in the country, which has seen a dramatic improvement in security in recent years. No British royal has visited Pakistan since William&amp;acute;s father Prince Charles and his wife Camilla came 13 years ago, just as Pakistan was plunged into the worst of its long, bloody battle with militancy.The Cambridges spent their five-day tour promoting causes such as girls&amp;acute; education, conservation and climate change awareness, while winning praise for their tributes to Pakistani designers and huge smiles as they took part in each event. The palace had called the trip their "most complex" tour to date as the couple sought to boost ties between Britain and the second largest country in the Commonwealth.William&amp;acute;s mother, the late Princess Diana, charmed Pakistanis on her own visits to the country two decades ago, and nostalgia for her lay heavy over the trip, both for Pakistanis and for Britons watching from home. Pakistani press repeatedly flashed archive photos of Diana on her visits, comparing her to Kate. The couple also met with Prime Minister Imran Khan, an old friend of Diana&amp;acute;s, and visited the cancer hospital he founded which she had helped raise funds for.</Description>

  <Title>The Indian outfit - batting, bowling and fielding - is exceptional: Brian Lara</Title>
  <Description>
    

Photo: File&amp;nbsp;MUMBAI: West Indies batting great Brian Lara hailed India's cricket teams and said that they&amp;nbsp; are a force to be reckoned with anywhere in the world.India completed their 11th consecutive Test series win at home last week when they took an unassailable 2-0 lead in the ongoing three-match series against South Africa.They are also the only unbeaten team in the recently launched World Test Championship with four wins from as many matches &amp;mdash; two of them coming in the West Indies in their previous Test series.Lara, who once held the record for most runs in Test cricket before being overtaken by Sachin Tendulkar, said Virat Kohli&amp;rsquo;s men would have to show a level of consistency for them to be considered in the same league as the world-beating sides of West Indies and Australia of the past.&amp;ldquo;We all know the Indian team was not the most respected when they travelled. They were very respected at home but now India on a world stage anywhere they play is a force to be reckoned with,&amp;rdquo; Lara told reporters at an event in Mumbai on Thursday.&amp;ldquo;Well, those teams dominated world cricket ... the West Indies in the &amp;lsquo;70s and &amp;lsquo;80s, the Australians in the &amp;lsquo;90s and the early part of the 21st century. India has that capability.&amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re now travelling well, they&amp;rsquo;re playing abroad and beating oppositions, which is great. World cricket is a lot more competitive now &amp;mdash; Australia, South Africa and England.&amp;ldquo;So India will have to do it over a period of time, dominating all teams to be considered. But they are definitely a top cricketing nation at the moment.&amp;rdquo;India have occupied top spot in the world Test rankings since late 2016 and lot of that credit, according to pundits, goes to their fast bowlers.Lara, who scored 11,953 runs from 131 Tests and still holds the record for the highest score of 400 not out in an innings, said India batting mainstay Kohli was the &amp;ldquo;ultimate captain&amp;rdquo; and the side&amp;rsquo;s fast bowlers were &amp;ldquo;unbelievable&amp;rdquo;.&amp;ldquo;The Indian outfit - batting, bowling and fielding - is exceptional,&amp;rdquo; the 50-year-old said. &amp;ldquo;I thought their fast bowlers were sometimes unplayable (against West Indies).&amp;ldquo;I saw (India) in the West Indies and I must say what I was accustomed to in the past ... this is pretty special.&amp;ldquo;And the guys that you have on the sidelines, it reminds me a little bit of what the West Indies had back in the &amp;lsquo;80s and &amp;lsquo;90s ... the reserve strength is very important in assessing a team&amp;rsquo;s ability.&amp;rdquo;</Description>

According to journalist Emily Andrews, who was also on the Royal Air Force, as the weathered turned bad, &amp;ldquo;Prince William came back to check everyone was OK.&amp;rdquo; He further joked that the extreme turbulence was due to him flying the aircraft,&amp;rdquo; she wrote on Twitter. &amp;ldquo;(He&amp;rsquo;s an experienced pilot). He also joked we could all go out for a night out in Lahore together!&amp;rdquo; Andrews added.&amp;nbsp;Another Royal correspondent Rebecca English, who was also among those travelling with the UK dignitaries shared a short video of mid-air drama.The Duke completed his pilot training with the Royal Air Force college in 2009.

  <Title>Indian media reports that Pakistan will likely avoid FATF black-list</Title>
  <Description>
    

Pakistan is likely to avoid being placed on a black list of countries responsible for terror financing, according to a report published by Indian news publication The Times of India. A meeting of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), currently underway in Paris, is expected to make a final decision on Friday with regards to placing Pakistan on the black-list and announcing it to the media.Economic Affairs Minister Hammad Azhar is leading a Pakistan delegation at the meeting. The delegation earlier this week presented FATF a compliance report of Pakistan on a previously agreed action plan. The Indian publication claims that Islamabad had secured the three votes required to keep a country off the FATF blacklist. Reports earlier had indicated that China, Turkey and Malaysia are backing Pakistan at FATF.China is also presiding over the current meeting of the financial action task force, that could help the Pakistan effort to avert the black-list further. Last year, FATF had placed Pakistan on a grey-list of countries responsible for terror-financing, presenting Islamabad with a 27-point action plan to adopt strict anti-money laundering measures.In June this year, the financial body gave Pakistan another four months to impenitent the action plan. This week, the FATF reviewed a compliance report of Paistan in this regard. The black-listing of a country by the financial task force usually results in economic sanctions and trade penalties. imposed and implemented by the G-7 nations. Grey-listing by the FATF does not lead to sanctions.&amp;nbsp;</Description>

  <Title>Pakistan playing pivotal role in region's peace, security: Foreign Minister </Title>
  <Description>
    

ISLAMABAD: Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi on Thursday said in pursuit of its foreign policy objectives, Pakistan was playing a pivotal role in promoting peace, security and stability in the region and beyond."We do not see our quest for security as a zero-sum game. Rather, we believe in win-win outcomes, maximizing the dividends for all," the Foreign Minister said in his address to the students at Air University at a discussion on ''Pakistan's Foreign Policy''.The Foreign Minister expressed hope that other countries would reciprocate Pakistan's constructive approach to set a new momentum for peace, progress and prosperity.Qureshi said Pakistan was focusing on the domestic priorities of people-centered economic development and creation of a welfare state, while at external front, a &amp;ldquo;peaceful neighborhood&amp;rdquo; remained the defining construct."We believe there is enormous potential to grow and, with progressive, pragmatic and liberal policies, we can infuse economic dynamism internally in Pakistan and across the region," he said.He said in a daunting environment, Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s foreign policy priorities were defined to deal with the continuing challenges while taking benefit of emerging opportunities."The over-arching framework for our foreign policy continues to be encapsulated by the Quaid&amp;rsquo;s dictum of &amp;ldquo;Peace within, Peace without&amp;rdquo;, he said.The foreign minister mentioned challenging relations with India particularly in the backdrop of its unilateral decision on changing the status of Jammu and Kashmir.He said the inhuman lockdown of eight million people, continuing for over 70 days, was imposing unspeakable sufferings on the people of Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.  He said Prime Minister Imran Khan made a strong case at the UN General Assembly that the curfew in IOJ&amp;K must be immediately lifted and the Kashmiris be given the right to self-determination.The foreign minister said the desperate attempt by India to portray a situation of &amp;ldquo;normalcy&amp;rdquo; in IOJ&amp;K was in sharp contrast to reports of torture and detention by the international media."We will continue to stand by Kashmiris in their just struggle for realization of the right to self-determination," he said, pointing out that India was also pursuing a massive build-up of its nuclear and conventional military forces and acquiring destabilising capabilities."This country resorts to war-mongering and issues nuclear threats including for short term domestic electoral gains.It has repeatedly signalled changes to its declaratory nuclear posture while flirting with pre-emptive and counter-force tendencies," he said.Qureshi said these hegemonic pretensions, coupled with a history of aggression against its neighbours, presented a clear and existing danger to regional stability, and to Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s security.He said Pakistan desired peace and strategic stability in order to focus on its socio-economic development agenda."Our conduct continues to be defined by restraint and responsibility, and the avoidance of an arms race.Pakistan, however, cannot remain oblivious to the evolving security dynamics in its immediate neighbourhood," he said.On Afghanistan, he said Pakistan remained committed to supporting all efforts aimed at restoring peace in the country.On China, he said the all-weather strategic cooperative partnership was an anchor of peace and stability in the region.The foreign minister said Pakistan had achieved significant success in fighting terrorism at a staggering human and financial cost, adding that terrorist networks had been disrupted and their infrastructure degraded.He said tourism industry has witnessed a surge in recent months and expressed confidence that Pakistan would become an attractive destination for international investors and tourists.</Description>
